# DSCI-100-FINAL-PROJECT

## Repository Structure
* README.md: Overview and guide to the project.
* project_report.ipynb: R Markdown file containing the code and analysis for the project.
## Getting Started
* To replicate the analysis:

1. Install R and the required packages: tidyverse, tidymodels, kknn.
2. Download the dataset from the provided link.
3. Open the project_report.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Set the working directory to the location where the data file is saved.
5. Run the code chunks in the R Markdown file to perform the analysis.
### Note: Basic knowledge of R and familiarity with data preprocessing, KNN classification, and model evaluation techniques are assumed.

## Results
* The results of the analysis include the evaluation of the classifiers' accuracy, the optimal K value selected, and a comparison between the models. Confusion matrices provide insights into the performance of the models in predicting the risk of fraud.

> For detailed code and analysis, refer to the project_report.ipynb file.

> Note: This is a showcase repository which is meant to showcase the final version of the project. This project was part of UBC DSCI 100 course which required many steps in between including a proposal and a draft version.
