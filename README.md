# DSCI-100-FINAL-PROJECT

Repository Structure
README.md: Overview and guide to the project.
draft.ipynb: R Markdown file containing the code and analysis for the project.
Getting Started
To replicate the analysis:

Install R and the required packages: tidyverse, tidymodels, kknn.
Download the dataset (trial.csv) from the provided link.
Open the draft.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Set the working directory to the location where the trial.csv file is saved.
Run the code chunks in the R Markdown file to perform the analysis.
Note: Basic knowledge of R and familiarity with data preprocessing, KNN classification, and model evaluation techniques are assumed.

Results
The results of the analysis include the evaluation of the classifiers' accuracy, the optimal K value selected, and a comparison between the models. Confusion matrices provide insights into the performance of the models in predicting the risk of fraud.

For detailed code and analysis, refer to the draft.ipynb file.
